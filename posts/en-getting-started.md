## Why Go?

Go (or Golang) is a programming language developed by Google with many advantages:

- **Easy to learn** - Simple syntax that's easy to understand
- **High performance** - Runs nearly as fast as C/C++
- **Concurrency support** - Built-in goroutines and channels for parallel execution
- **Complete tooling** - Comes with formatter, tester, and build tools

## Code Example

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

## Summary

Go is perfect for developing:
1. Web Services and APIs
2. Command-line tools
